This solution provides a template "Hello World" web application with Spring MVC and friends.

The "Hello World"-iness goes well beyond what the web application does, rather the template prescribes a way of working and includes matters such as exposing basic production-ready monitoring features.

The cited friends include:

* http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/[HTML5]
* http://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] as HTML5 templating engine
* http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/[Bootstrap v3.3.5]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html[Spring MVC v4.2.0]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Security v4.2.0]

Key template aspects include:

* An over-arching aspiration to adhere to http://roca-style.org/[Resource-Oriented Architecture] (ROCA) recommendations.
* A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement[progressive enhancement] validation strategy realized by server-side first validation using http://beanvalidation.org/1.0/spec/[JSR 303] annotations on form-backing objects - this means if we are constrained for time we will have no client-side validation which is treated as a convenience.
* Asynchronous client-side validation is enabled by optionally exposing, for each form, a JSON based validation end-point.
* Bootstrap's responsive, mobile first fluid grid system respected to make sure all devices are supported (i.e. extra small, small, medium and large devices).
* Intentional avoidance of JSP, JSTL and the Spring tag libraries as per http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thvsjsp.html[Spring MVC View Layer: Thymeleaf vs JSP].
* Internationalization: support for English (for which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters[ASCII] would suffice) and at least one language that uses a character set with "funny" characters. This is a http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html[character encoding] lesson reminder.

Getting up and running:

* mvn spring-boot:run or run the Application class
* to log in use the credentials: user and password
